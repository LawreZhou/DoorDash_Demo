# DoorDash_Demo
Analyze the DoorDash delivery data, to predict actual delivery duration.

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze the DoorDash delivery data, and build a predictive model to determine the acutal delivery duration based on various features.
The dataset contains information about each delivery's store category, subtotal, number of busy dashers, total dashers available, and more.

## Usage
1. The dataset can be found in the same repositoray as the Jupyter Notebook file.
2. Follow the step-by-step analysis in the notebook to explore the data, preprocess it, and build the predictive model.

## Data
The DoorDash dataset includes the following columns:
- market_id	created_at
- actual_delivery_time
- store_id
- store_primary_category
- order_protocol
- total_items	subtotal
- num_distinct_items
- min_item_price
- max_item_price
- total_onshift_dashers
- total_busy_dashers
- total_outstanding_orders
- estimated_order_place_duration
- estimated_store_to_consumer_driving_duration
